Version: 1.0 - 20212809


## INTRODUCTION

Almanak is an easy to use calendar that is written in PHP an MySql script.
It is written to work well with  PHP version 7.

Activities stored in the MySql database are stored in the same way as the Calendarix calendar who is created by Vincent Hor. 
So if you are a Calendarix user and you have a little bit knowledge of MySql it is possible to copy your activities from Calendarix to Almanak. 

Almanak provide multiple views:
	- year view
	- month view
	- list view
	
Apart from adding events you can also add yearly repeating events like holidays, this can be done in the settings tab (admin only).

Almanak can also send e-mails every time you add or change an activity, this is done by filling in the e-mail address field in the setting page.

For now only the English and Dutch language are fully implemented. If you have a little bit knowledge of coding, you are free to add your own translation. 


## INSTALLATION
To install read the install.txt that you can find in the install folder. 

## How to use
After you've installed Amanak you can login using "root" for both username and password.
When you are logged in you can change the name of the root users in the user tab.
It is also possible to add extra users. There are three groups to which the users can be assigned: user 1, user 2 and admin. 
For now the user 1 and user 2 group are the same and can only add, change or remove activities. The users of the admin group can add, remove and change activities, users and holidays.
Admin user can also change the settings of Almanak. 
It's important to always have one or more user in the admin group, otherwise you won't be able to add or remove users and change the settings. 

Add, change or remove activities is strait forward so there is no info how to do this.
